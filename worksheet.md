Clone this repository (well done!)

# Task 1

Take a look at the two repositories:

  * (A) https://bitbucket.org/altmattr/personalised-correlation/src/master/
  * (B) https://github.com/Whiley/WhileyCompiler

And answer the following questions about them:

  * These repositories are at two different websites - github and bitbucket - what are these sites?  What service do they provide? Which is better?
Both services offer Version control, Repo hosting and collaboration. Github also offers social networking while bitbucket has excellent integration with other Atlassian tools.
Both services are great for version control and are often used simultaneously for different projects.

  * Who made the last commit to repository A? - Matthew Roberts
  * Who made the first commit to repository A? - Jon Mountjoy
  * Who made the first and last commits to repository B? - Dave Pearce
  * Are either/both of these projects active at the moment? ðŸ¤” If not, what do you think happened?
  Repo b has not been active for almost a year - "next release" was being worked on last, maybe a more advanced version/rewritten version was in the works.
  Repo A also hasn't been updated in almost a year.

  * ðŸ¤” Which file in each project has had the most activity?
  The main/master branches have the most commits in each repo.
# Task 2

The repository you just cloned is a VSCode project, so lets work with it.  It currently will print "Hello World" message to the console when run.

You will find "Run" and "Debug" commands over the `main` method.  Try them out.  You can also trigger them with `F5` for "Debug" and `Ctrl-F5` for "Run"

Modify the application so that instead it prints
